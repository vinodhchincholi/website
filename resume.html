      <h2>Fine-tuning Large Language Models</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Significant amount of time dedicated for preprocessing & encoding to make suitable for analysis. Binary encoding for yes/no features, ordinal encoding for education and one-hot encoding for remaining features.</li>
        <li>Since our labels were skewed, recall was chosen as evaluation metric to err on catching potential customers.</li>
        <li>Used grid-search for hyper-parameter tuning and got accuracies > 85%. Adaboost won with 89% accuracy.</li>
